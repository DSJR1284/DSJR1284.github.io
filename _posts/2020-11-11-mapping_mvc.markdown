When I started this project. It was a bit overwhelming. I felt like there was alot of information we got extremly quickly. 
So before tackling this project I wrote out a map of how I wanted my MVC to behave and what attributes I wanted my Users and my Comics to have. 

I wanted my Users to 
-Username
-Password
-Image 
-Bio 

I wanted my Comics to 
-Title
-Image
-Blurb

The relationship bewtween the two was also set wiith a User having many comics and comics beloing to a user. 
Before I wrtiing any code there was already an idea of control flow. 

This also help becasue when It came to making my views.  I already had an idea of what I wanted to display to the users.
its was just a matter of building it out. 

The last part was the controllers and this is where the fun began. Understanding how to send information from my get to my post routes. 

Mapping out the routes in the controller was easily the biggest challegnes .  It was a lot of trial and error or as we like to say TDD (Test Driven Development). 

Building out your controllers will take time. The best advie is test and test often take advantage of bingding.pry when ever you can to see excatly what your are getting and if your code is working. 

Having a good map  is important and it helps you see exctaly how you want your app to work and allows you to make changes without have to rework a lot of code. 

Be patient with yourself and the process. Happy Coding.
