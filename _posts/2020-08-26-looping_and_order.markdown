Hi, welcome to my blog about how I decided to put things in order. 

One of the most diffcult parts of setting this project up was knowing what order I wanted my program to follow. 

The way I decided to overcome this challenge was to use pseudo code. 

In case you are not fimilar with the term, pseudo code is writing out and organizing your code before you actually write any code. Its a great way to organize your  program. It helps you outline what code you need to write and where to place things in order to make you application work. It helps to put things in order before you invest a lot of time writing out codes and methods with no direction. 

My pseudo code looked like this :

Order Of Operation

1) Greet or Welcome the user.  
2) Display films and instruction for the user to follow 
3) Display film, description, and release date based on the user's input. 
4) Display information base on user input .
5) User can return to the films list or exit the program.

This allowed me to know exactly how I wanted my program to operate.


Below I have place a link to a short video walk through of how my pseudo code helped with organizing my project

This is just one approach of many. I hope this helps you on your coding journey.
