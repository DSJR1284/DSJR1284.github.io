Before we being lets go back and look at the definition of looping in programing. 

What is a loop?  

1) Loops allow us to tell our program to run a certain function or task a set number of times. 

2) Loops also allow us to set conditon for how our program will operate in certain situation.

One of the most diffcult parts of looping is the order you want your program to follow. We will often ask ourselves 
What will my program do and when?
How many times do I want my program to run these function or tasks?
What condition do I need to prepare for? 

Just to name a few.

One way to overcame this is to write psudeo code. 

In case you are not fimilar with the term

Psudeo code is a approach of writing out what you want your code to do before you actually start writing any code. 
Its a great way to orgainze your code and program and it helps to put things in order. 

For my CLI I used this method to help orgainze how I wanted my program to loop and what conditions it would respond to. 

My pseudo code looked like this. 

Order Of Operation

1) Greet the user 
2) Display menu option 
3) Recieve user input
4)Display information base on user input 
5)Return to step (2) or end program. 

This allowed me to know excatly how I wanted my program to loop, how many times it would loop and when to end. 

This is just one approach to Looping as there are many other ways to approach this tasks. 
I hope this helps you on your programming journey.
