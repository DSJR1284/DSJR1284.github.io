My name is Doug Jones currently I am working in a warehouse going no where at all. After having a talk with my sister about finding a career she gave me some really good advice. She told my "Your career is what you choose not whats handed to you". 

About a year ago I deceded to attemtp to self study and get into the world of IT and get my A+ certfication. It didn't end up going so well. I failed and had a serious injury which completely rock my world up into the point where I almost considered suicide.

As I continued to look into the wolrd of IT I stumbled onto Career Karma and began to start learnig about coding. I started to use little apps like grasshopper and codecademy to see if it was a better option. 

As I learned more it seems like software engineering just seem to naturally fit my personalilty as it allows me to grow and never be stuck in the same place. I love problem solvng. Being an athlete most of my life the idea of working in a team to solve problems in second nature to me as well as it will allow me to bring some of my own personal ideas to life to help others. 

In hindsight Software Engineering just seems like a natural match for me.
